Write a program that creates two 9 elements in 2D (3 x 3 Matrix Format) and assign each matrix with 
1. The first 9 even numbers (2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18)
2. The first 9 odd numbers(1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17)



Now find
i) the product of the leading diagonal elements of both matrices and display the results

ii) the difference of the product of the trailing and the leading diagonal elements

iii)the difference between the products of the trailing diagonal of the odd matrix and the trailing diagonal of the even matrix
