Miss Ama, a lecturer at KNUST, after the semester recorded the marks of her students wrongly. She marked both the mid semester exams out 
of 100 instead of 30 and 70 respectively. She came to you as a programmer to develop for her a computer program that can scale the marks of 
students down to 30 and 70. and then find the total score. The program is supposed to take student id, name, marks for both exams and output 
the grade of each student.

Also it should output. 
- Highest score and name and id of the student that got it 
- Lowest score and name and id of the student that got it 
- Average Score of students
- Frequency of grades


Solution

Ill use arrays and obviously. 

Variables / Arrays....

numStudents, name[], studentID[], midSemscore[], examScore[], 
totalScore[], 
grade, gradeA, gradeB, gradeC, gradeD, gradeE, gradeF--counters 
for the grade frequency

totalSum, minScore, maxScore
